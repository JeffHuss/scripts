# Installation Instuctions (bash only):
#   1) Place this file (jbuild.sh) in a local folder (such as ~/Documents as an example).
#          $ mv jbuild.sh ~/Documents
#   2) Change directories to the location of the script:
#          $ cd ~/Documents
#   2) Make this script executable by running the following command:
#          $ chmod 755 jbuild.sh
#   3) Verify that /usr/local/bin/ is part of your path by checking the output of the following command:
#          $ echo $PATH
#   4) If it isn't, add it:
#          $ export PATH="/usr/local/bin/:$PATH"
#   5) Create a symlink to the script in /usr/local/bin/ (this allows you to run the script from any directory):
#          $ sudo ln -s ~/Documents/jbuild.sh /usr/local/bin/jbuild
#          NOTE: Make sure to change the path to the script if it isn't in ~/Documents!
#   6) Navigate to the folder containing the page you would like to build and run the command "jbuild"
#          NOTE: Currently this can be used to build documentation-website and project-website. You may still
#                need to run "bundle install" if you haven't done so already. This requires manually adding a
#                line to the relevant Gemfile, (gem "webrick"), running "bundle install" from that directory,
#                and then proceeding with this script. When the script completes it will clean up any running
#                processes associated with the port you defined.
